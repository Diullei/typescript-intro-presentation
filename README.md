# Introduction to TypeScript Presentation

Slides for a tech talk I presented on Friday 12/10/2012 titled "TypeScript: JavaScript for tools" as one of the primary design goals for the language is to provided development tooling support.

Created using the wonderful [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) for building HTML presentations. Styling has been gratuitously borrowed from [www.typescriptlang.org](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

A highlight of the slide deck is that each of the TypeScript code snippets shown are compiled to JavaScript on slide navigation using the TypeScript compiler itself. The presentation goes through how to host the compiler within a html page, or view the source of `presentation.html` and `assets/compiler.js` for further details.
